<b>Memory Maya</b>
Match It! Tell a Story! Have a Race! Make a Contest! Memory Maya is an awesome game for developing a strong Sanskrit vocabulary on ‘Values from the Bhagavad Gita’. This game has focused on contemporary art representations for these values, with a deep reverence for the traditional words. In addition to playing a Memory game, these cards can be used for discussions, skit building and further collaborative games. The Artwork is the wonderful creation of Esha Sharma, a high school student from Long Island.
